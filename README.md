# Medical Image Segmentation with Probabilistic Atlas and EM Algorithm
In this project, the goal is to enhance medical image segmentation using a probabilistic atlas to improve spatial consistency and segmentation accuracy. Anatomic and probabilistic atlases serve as standardized references, which can guide the segmentation process by highlighting expected locations of anatomical structures. This is particularly useful when individual patient images vary due to acquisition conditions or anatomical differences. By providing a probabilistic representation of tissue distribution, these atlases improve segmentation robustness, especially in complex or low-contrast regions.

Project Objectives
This project represents the second part of an assignment for the Medical Imaging and Applications course (MISA). The primary objectives include:

Implementing and comparing various tissue segmentation strategies using the tissue models and probabilistic atlas developed in Part 1 of the assignment.
Applying these strategies to new subject data, both independently and in combination with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.
Evaluating the performance of these segmentation strategies on a provided dataset.
Analyzing the impact of EM algorithm adjustments on segmentation accuracy and consistency.
Key Components
Probabilistic Atlas Integration: Enhances segmentation by using a standardized anatomical reference.
Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm: Provides iterative refinement of segmentation, supporting the inclusion of atlas data.
This project aims to contribute to robust segmentation techniques by exploring the synergy between probabilistic atlas information and algorithmic approaches.
